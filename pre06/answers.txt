1. Table below:
    n    |    i    |    print output
    10        10        10
              5         5
              6         6
              3         3
              4         4
              2         2
              1         1

2. The output of this program can be seen in the column to the farthest right. It would be: 
    10
    5
    6
    3
    4
    2
    1

3. This loop will terminate for all positive values because of the else condition. The else condition ensures that if a number is not divisible by 2 (making it odd and therefore woudl result in a decimal), they add one making it even. This will widdle the number down to 2 and when you divide 2 by 2 you get one -- ending the loop.




TASK: 
Exercise 1: Consider the following method:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    loop(10);
}

public static void loop(int n) {
    int i = n;
    while (i > 1) {
        System.out.println(i);
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            i = i / 2;
        } else {
            i = i + 1;
        }
    }
}

1. Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration.
2. What is the output of this program?
3. Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n?
